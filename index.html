        <p>I have always had a love for computers ever since I was a little girl and my dad brought home our first family shared computer, I was hooked. I felt a connection with it and wanted to learn how it worked, what I could do with it and spent many hours on it (much to the chagrin of my 5 siblings). I felt a bond with it as if I could understand them better than people. So it made sense to go into a line of work that involved daily computer usage. I have worked at many corporations at different jobs over the years but nothing ever seemed to fit right until I found my current company Spemco Switches.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I have been at Spemco for 16 years and they not only embraced my love and bond with computers but encouraged it. As an autodidact without any formal training they allowed me to build an e-commerce website, learning along the way, paid for me to do training in computers and with Google and for me to attend MSU to become a full stack developer. They have always supported me and my dream and I am so blessed to work for a company that treats me like family. That website is my baby and they have trusted me with it since day 1, from inception to design, functionality to advertising and marketing, that website awoke such a passion for coding and development in me. I never dreamed I would be a full stack developer and now I cannnot imagine doing anything else. My love for all things computers is second only to my love for my daughter Adrianna Rose, my friends and family as well as my dogs Bruno & Bella.</p>
